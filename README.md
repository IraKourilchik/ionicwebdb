IK My Little Farm uses cordova-plugin-media to play sounds
Ripple emulator doesn't issue deviceReady event that is why it throws an exception when application tries to play sound file
Cordova browser support was added to the application
To test application 
1. run 'cordova run browser'
2. press F12 to see how application will look on the device (in Chrome)
